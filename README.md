# Context-Aware Query Interpretation System for Data in Higher Education

This repository contains the dataset and evaluation queries used in the article **"Context-Aware Query Interpretation System for Data in Higher Education"**, submitted to ECML PKDD 2025 under the Applied Data Science track.

## About the Article

The paper presents a system designed to enable **non-technical users** to query complex **higher education databases** using **natural language**. By integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs), ontology-based context modeling, and role-based personalization**, the system enhances accessibility to institutional data, facilitating **data-driven decision-making**.

The evaluation focused on usability, accuracy, and scalability, using a synthetic dataset derived from real academic data. The dataset ensures privacy while reflecting real-world scenarios encountered in universities.
